/**
 * @class `MSWeakTimer` behaves similar to an `NSTimer` but doesn't retain the target/delegate.
 * @discussion this timer is implemented using GCD, so you can schedule and unschedule it on arbitrary queues
 * (unlike regular NSTimers!)
 * It's safe to retain this timer by the object that is also the delegate.
 * You can call -invalidate from any queue, doesn't have to be the queue from where you scheduled it
 * or the provided dispatchQueue.
 * @param dispatchQueue the queue where the delegate method will be dispatched. Note: the queue is retained.
 * @see `-invalidate`.
