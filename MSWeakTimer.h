 `MSWeakTimer` behaves similar to an `NSTimer` but doesn't retain the target.
 This timer is implemented using GCD, so you can schedule and unschedule it on arbitrary queues (unlike regular NSTimers!)

/**
 * Creates a timer with the specified parameters and waits for a call to `-schedule` to start ticking.
 * @note It's safe to retain the returned timer by the object that is also the target.
 * or the provided `dispatchQueue`.
 * @param timeInterval how frequently `selector` will be invoked on `target`. If the timer doens't repeat, it will only be invoked once, approximately `timeInterval` seconds from the time you call this method.
 * @param repeats if `YES`, `selector` will be invoked on `target` until the `MSWeakTimer` object is deallocated or until you call `invalidate`. If `NO`, it will only be invoked once.
 * @param dispatchQueue the queue where the delegate method will be dispatched. It can be either a serial or concurrent queue.
 * @see `invalidate`.

/**
 * Sets the amount of time after the scheduled fire date that the timer may fire to the given interval.
 * @discussion Setting a tolerance for a timer allows it to fire later than the scheduled fire date, improving the ability of the system to optimize for increased power savings and responsiveness. The timer may fire at any time between its scheduled fire date and the scheduled fire date plus the tolerance. The timer will not fire before the scheduled fire date. For repeating timers, the next fire date is calculated from the original fire date regardless of tolerance applied at individual fire times, to avoid drift. The default value is zero, which means no additional tolerance is applied. The system reserves the right to apply a small amount of tolerance to certain timers regardless of the value of this property.
 As the user of the timer, you will have the best idea of what an appropriate tolerance for a timer may be. A general rule of thumb, though, is to set the tolerance to at least 10% of the interval, for a repeating timer. Even a small amount of tolerance will have a significant positive impact on the power usage of your application. The system may put a maximum value of the tolerance.
